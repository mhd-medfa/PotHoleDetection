# Pot Hole Detection
Potholes have become a huge problem for most drivers. With the South African government spending over R22 billion over the past 3 years on pothole repair programs and the Automobile Association(AA) acknowledging more than 5% of road deaths to unmaintained road structure (potholes).

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a pothole.
